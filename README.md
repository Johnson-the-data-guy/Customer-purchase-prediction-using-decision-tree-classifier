# **Customer Purchase Prediction**  

## **Overview**  
This project builds a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their **demographic and behavioral data**. The model is trained using datasets such as the **Bank Marketing dataset** from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**.  

## **Dataset**  
The dataset contains customer-related attributes such as:  
- **Demographic Data** (Age, Job, Marital Status, Education, etc.)  
- **Behavioral Data** (Previous Campaign Responses, Contact Duration, Communication Type, etc.)  
- **Outcome Variable** (Whether the customer purchased the product/service)  

## **Objectives**  
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the dataset.  
- Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.  
- Train a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict customer purchases.  
- Evaluate the model’s performance using metrics such as **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.  

## **Installation & Setup**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-purchase-prediction.git  
   cd customer-purchase-prediction  
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook  
   ```

## **Usage**  
- Open the Jupyter notebook and follow the steps for **data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation**.  
- Modify the **hyperparameters** to fine-tune the decision tree model.  

## **Evaluation Metrics**  
The model’s performance is evaluated using:  
✅ **Accuracy**  
✅ **Precision & Recall**  
✅ **Confusion Matrix**  
✅ **ROC Curve & AUC Score**  

## **Future Improvements**  
- Experiment with **Random Forest** and **Gradient Boosting** models for better performance.  
- Optimize feature selection to improve predictive power.  
- Deploy the model using **Flask or FastAPI** for real-time predictions.
